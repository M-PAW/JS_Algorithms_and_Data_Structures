// Step 1: Understanding the Problem

/*

    Understanding the Problem:

        1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
        2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        3. What are the outputs that should come from the
           solution to the problem?
        4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
            Is there enough information to solve the 
            problem?
        5. How should I label important pieces of data 
            that are a part of the problem?

// Write a function that takes two numbers and returns there sum.
    // Understanding:
    // 1. Implement addition
    // 2. Will there be an upper bounds for the digits / floats?
    // 3. What happens if there are more of less inputs
    // 4. What does the output need to look like?
    // 5. How should I label the import parts of the data?
