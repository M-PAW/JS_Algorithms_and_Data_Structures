/*

    What is log?
        log2(8) = ?
        2 to what power equals 8
        2^3 = 8

        Binary Logarithm such as 2 is most common.

        You must have a base number

        ** The logarithm of a number roughly measures the 
           number of times you can divide that number by 2 
           before you get a value that's less than or equal 
           to one.

        8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, log(8) = 3

        O(log n) is extremely good for a run-time.

        **  Why are logarithms important:

            Certain searching algorithms hace logarithmic time complexities,
            research them and become familiar.

            Efficient sorting algorithms also involve logarithms.

            Recursion sometimes involbes logarithmic space complexity.


    ****  Time or Space Complexty (as measured by BigO) depends only on the algorithm,
          not the hardware used to run the algorithm. Generally Speaking.
